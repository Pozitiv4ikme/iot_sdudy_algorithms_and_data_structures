Flood fill (also known as initial fill) is an algorithm that defines the region that a particular node in a multidimensional array is included in.

It is used in a drawing program's bucket fill tool to fill connected, same-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper.
Applying to fill a certain bounded area with color is also called border fill.

The fill algorithm takes three parameters: a start node, a target color, and a replacement color.
